Can you imagine if these resources didn’t exist?!\r\n\r\nAnd while our community is strong today, it’s healthiest when it continues to grow from a broad set of interests, backgrounds and opinions. That diversity and knowledge to keep our community strong can only come from one place: YOU.\r\n\r\nI’ll share my thoughts about how this community has helped me (and others) grow, why that’s so important, and ultimately why it’s crucial for all of us to contribute. I’ll discuss five (or so) areas, each with some high level tips to get you started, that we can all contribute to to keep our community strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll leave this talk not just grateful for our wonderful community, but also inspired to get started on contributing back too!\r\n\r\nThe Android community has proven to be one of the most welcoming, friendly, helpful, generous groups I’ve ever encountered. Let’s keep it going!\r\n",

In this session, we’ll look at some of the methods and tools inside the stdlib and dig into how they’re written to reveal intermediate to advanced language features, slick syntax and conventions, and high-level abstractions to help you write more fluent objects and interfaces. We’ll also take a few glances at the underlying bytecode to understand how and why the features work the way they do.",

At I/O 2018, Google released the Firebase ML Kit which offers a lot of more opportunity for Android Developers to build smarter apps with no previous Machine Learning expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Vision APIs introduced Face, Text and Barcode Detection and the Firebase ML Kit offers all these features and much more. Your apps can now also label images, identify popular landmarks in a picture and very soon will able to provide smart replies to messages.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about\r\n- All the functionality the ML Kit has to offer\r\n- How the ML Kit compares with the Mobile Vision API\r\n- A basic introduction to Machine Learning concepts\r\n \r\nYou’ll leave this talk empowered to introduce Machine Learning into your apps.",

A new very flexible testing framework, based on learning from many years of Junit 4.\r\nAt sporttotal we use this for our Android unit tests and it changed the way we write tests. Hard for us to imagine living without features like @Nested. Other features we ignored as those are more leaning towards Java and are solved already by Kotlin or other Kotlin libraries. And some features are even breaking changes. How do you test on Android in a world without TestRunner and TestRules? \r\nAndroid testing team was always very slowly in adopting to new Junit versions, so how far can we bypass this?\r\nLet's do a deep dive into Junit5, how it works and how we can use it on Android",

That diversity and knowledge to keep our community strong can only come from one place: YOU.\r\n\r\nI’ll share my thoughts about how this community has helped me (and others) grow, why that’s so important, and ultimately why it’s crucial for all of us to contribute. I’ll discuss five (or so) areas, each with some high level tips to get you started, that we can all contribute to to keep our community strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll leave this talk not just grateful for our wonderful community, but also inspired to get started on contributing back too!\r\n\r\nThe Android community has proven to be one of the most welcoming, friendly, helpful, generous groups I’ve ever encountered. Let’s keep it going!\r\n",

While you may have heard about one or both of these tools before, not a lot of information exists on the advantages they bring. This talk will cover those advantages both in the scope of your entire application but also with very localized examples in a single class or method. We'll also look at some tricks that D8 and R8 can do which their predecessors could not. Finally, we'll cover how to enable both tools in your build and recommendations to ensure you're getting the most out of each.",

A new very flexible testing framework, based on learning from many years of Junit 4.\r\nAt sporttotal we use this for our Android unit tests and it changed the way we write tests. Hard for us to imagine living without features like @Nested. Other features we ignored as those are more leaning towards Java and are solved already by Kotlin or other Kotlin libraries. And some features are even breaking changes. How do you test on Android in a world without TestRunner and TestRules? \r\nAndroid testing team was always very slowly in adopting to new Junit versions, so how far can we bypass this?\r\nLet's do a deep dive into Junit5, how it works and how we can use it on Android",

They are making a major comeback as many mainstream languages have introduced support for coroutines and similar mechanisms: async/await, channels, goroutines. Kotlin language designers figured out a way to emulate many of those patterns by pushing the details to the library functions and reserving only one keyword: suspend.",

CI for Android development is a problem that has been solved before, but it gets a lot more interesting to keep the same quality and speed with hundreds of changes a day and hundreds of developers working on the same project. In this talk, Gautam will walk through the history of Android CI at Uber, the UX improvements for developers interacting with it and how it evolved into delivering release builds on every change. You will also learn how to incorporate such processes into your CI and CD workflows.",

But, sometimes, building the full experience from scratch in both Kotlin and Swift is not a good option.\r\n\r\nWhen we at Meetup were launching a new, mobile-first product and wanted a new mobile app — only the second native app in our fifteen-year history — we wanted to build a great product on both platforms, but we only had a few engineers and a couple of months to do so.\r\n\r\nReact Native, with its promise to deliver truly native-quality experiences from a completely shared codebase, is one of the popular alternative ways to build a mobile app, but a lot of its documentation is targeted at web developers who want to make iOS apps. How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from \"git init\" to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else. And we’ll be sure, throughout it all, not to treat Android as the second-most-important mobile platform.",

The results are meant to become a resource for the Kotlin community. Something we can all look at for interesting insights that will also help drive adoption of Kotlin in our teams and organisations.\r\n\r\nTo give you a taster, here’s a few questions I asked in the survey:\r\nHow big is Android as a proportion of all Kotlin developers?\r\nAre people happy naming libraries and tooling with K?\r\nWhat are the favourite features of the language?\r\nWhat kind of DSLs are people building with Kotlin and for what use-cases\r\n\r\nIn my talk will answer all these questions, and more.

We'll discuss the inner workings of how BillingX is implemented, how it can be integrated into your existing projects, and how you can either use it or easily create your own implementation.",

It will focus on how SQLDelight can be best used from both Android and iOS while feeling natural to Kotlin and Swift users alike, and go over features introduced in the release that affect all platforms. Finally we will explore the future of multiplatform including other components of your app which are good or bad candidates for making platform agnostic and what future releases of SQLDelight will include.",

Okio makes I/O easy by solving the most common problems in a simple and efficient way.\r\n\r\nAt Square, we’re investing in Kotlin. We love the language and the tooling, and we love how Kotlin makes us more productive. We’re excited about being able to run Kotlin on multiple platforms, and we’d love to be able to harness the power of Okio on Web and iOS - that’s why we’ve embarked on a journey to migrate Okio to multiplatform Kotlin!\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll share our experiences and namely:\r\n\r\n- What worked for us and what didn’t\r\n- Our strategy for moving fast without breaking code\r\n- Maintaining compatibility: Java source vs Kotlin source vs bytecode\r\n- Issues we’ve encountered along the way and ways to work around them\r\n- Performance considerations\r\n- How this impacts OkHttp, Retrofit, Moshi & Wire\r\n\r\nThis talk should be of interest to anyone who works with multiplatform Kotlin or wants to learn more about it.",

                          "description": "Building a successful product on mobile means that you have to provide a quality experience to both Android and iOS users. But, sometimes, building the full experience from scratch in both Kotlin and Swift is not a good option.\r\n\r\nWhen we at Meetup were launching a new, mobile-first product and wanted a new mobile app — only the second native app in our fifteen-year history — we wanted to build a great product on both platforms, but we only had a few engineers and a couple of months to do so.\r\n\r\nReact Native, with its promise to deliver truly native-quality experiences from a completely shared codebase, is one of the popular alternative ways to build a mobile app, but a lot of its documentation is targeted at web developers who want to make iOS apps. How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from \"git init\" to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else. And we’ll be sure, throughout it all, not to treat Android as the second-most-important mobile platform.",

My goal was to learn how developers use and adopt Kotlin - either in work or side projects, or just for playing around, and what are some of the most popular resources for learning it.\r\nThe survey was a great success, and gained 2744 responses in total! The results are meant to become a resource for the Kotlin community. Something we can all look at for interesting insights that will also help drive adoption of Kotlin in our teams and organisations.\r\n\r\nTo give you a taster, here’s a few questions I asked in the survey:\r\nHow big is Android as a proportion of all Kotlin developers?\r\nAre people happy naming libraries and tooling with K?\r\nWhat are the favourite features of the language?\r\nWhat kind of DSLs are people building with Kotlin and for what use-cases\r\n\r\nIn my talk will answer all these questions, and more.

The tool contains rules for style, performance and potential bugs. The tool is fully configurable so that you may turn off and set thresholds for these rules. It is also extensible so that you could create your own custom rules from your style guide. This tool goes a long way to enforcing good practices in your code base.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the library performs checks against these rules by analyzing the abstract syntax tree provided by the Kotlin Compiler. In this talk, we will learn about how to setup Detekt and how to create custom rules. We will also take a deep dive into how the library enforces these rules by using the abstract syntax tree.",
