To prepare for this bright future, he got himself a summer job on an archaeological dig. It turned out to be a very rainy summer and there were few large rolling boulders. One evening the man in charge took him aside, looked at him with haunted eyes, and said: \"Don't become an archaeologist.\" \r\n\r\nSo Richard got himself a PhD in distributed computing and embarked on a career in tech instead. At some point he took a wrong turn and got lost in the middle of Mongolia. That day he realized the importance of great maps. This led him to HERE, where he currently manages Developer Relations and helps developers find their way using the leading location cloud. He lives in Berlin, where you can still afford the rent.”\r\n",
