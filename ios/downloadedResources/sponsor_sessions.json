        "description": "It's 2022. Developers have seen it all. They've tried it all. But it seems all is just not enough. The quest for simple has led us to a path of complexity that is often needless. Or is it? Was it all just a lie? Was it all about job security?\r\n\r\nAs the world moves towards businesses that demand even more developer resources, can we as an industry come together and think about how we can make the world a simpler place? Or will complexity take over even more?\r\n\r\nIn the Director's cut of Silver Bullet Syndrome, we'll see where we are as an industry, and more importantly, how we've ended up in a twisted and unnecessarily complex situation. \r\n\r\n",

But only the adventurous of you are ready to find the little gems.\r\nDid you wonder what a Kotlin Native binary is made of? We'll have a deep look into its machinery, how to inspect binaries, and even disassemble a native Kotlin function using an open-source tool provided by the NSA. Then we will build our own treasure - a tiny Docker image with a Kotlin program.\r\nWe'll then sail over to the Multiplatform island and find out how multi-module projects can be achieved, how to build & distribute KMP libraries using Swift Package, Git & Artifactory, and how to speed up compilation in times of need.\r\nCome along this journey - and be surprised what you'll find!",

On the other hand, we don't really want to handle errors and therefore we quite often forget about them & their relevance.\r\n\r\nThe failure in software is something inevitable, our code can fail, the backend connection can fail and even the device could also fail. Error handling techniques are there to help us properly react when an expected or unexpected error might happen.\r\n\r\nFrom the functional programming, the monad design pattern comes to the rescue handling whichever response we can get,  either success or error. We'll explore some of the specific Android and Kotlin related approaches for it.\r\n\r\nAfter attending this lightning talk you'll have a broader perspective on the importance of error handling and the different ways that you can treat the different scenarios you may face.",

        "description": "What's the holy grail of test automation? UI testing/E2E testing, of course! Unfortunately, the fickle nature of UI interaction during development, test flakiness, and user scenario permutations make this difficult to achieve. This is particularly the case in mobile app development due to a large number of device configurations (including OS versions, device form factors, and device manufacturers).\r\n\r\nWe all know that it's important to begin testing for issues as early as possible. Yet the great challenge to \"shifting left\" is that UI automation takes time and requires skilled engineers to build who are in short supply in this job market. \r\n\r\nUsing a combination of no-code/lowcode approach, seamless CI integration, and built-in resiliency to reduce flakiness, we can make this a viable approach that is less costly or time-consuming.  We will discuss pros and cons of various approaches  (scripting, low code, nocode) to solving this problem and delve into one that we have pioneered in Sofy.\r\n",

This presents certain challenges when working with the Navigation Components library:\r\n* How do we determine NavDestinations that are in other libraries, without access to their NavGraphs?\r\n* How do we change the way backstack fragments behave based on past NavDestinations?\r\n* How do we safely maintain state for each Fragment in the backstack?\r\n\r\nAnd not least - how can we solve all of these issues when working with Compose?\r\n\r\nAdd in multiple modules and multiple libraries, and writing clean navigation logic can get really messy. I’ve dealt with all of these complexities when working on heavily modularized applications. I’ll walk the audience through the lessons I learned, and how to push the Navigation library capabilities to the fullest extent.",

        "description": "Getting started with Kotlin is as easy as saying “I want lambdas”, sure — but that’s only scratching the surface of the brave new world that adopting Kotlin will open up for Java and Android developers. In this workshop we’ll look at a number of language features and tips to make the most of the Kotlin Programming Language™ in our day-to-day work.We’ll touch on several topics, including property delegates, threading and coroutines, callbacks vs function references, sealed classes, member and extension functions, default parameters, typealiases, data classes and destructuring. For each of them, we’ll go over a series of dos and don’ts and best practices making sure you get the most out of Kotlin.\r\n\r\nNote for attendees:\r\nMake sure you have a laptop computer with an up-to-date version of IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, with an up-to-date Kotlin plugin, and ideally the latest version of Kotlin and Gradle already in your local caches. We all know how conference Wi-Fi is :)",

        "description": "Android has been around for over 10 years, and has now become the most used operating system in the entire world. It is the go to operating system for all kinds of user facing devices. From car displays and airplane entertainment systems, to fitness gear and points of sale, users are having countless interactions with Android. Sometimes without even realizing it. Android reaches humans from all walks of life and it is our responsibility to make them feel welcome and help keep them safe.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover key considerations to add to your engineering practice. Not all users use their devices the same way and we will learn about many styles of interaction. Advocate for the user. Learn how to recognize and push back against dark patterns before they make their way into the public.\r\n\r\nBy putting these skills into practice, Android will continue to grow and be recognized as a great platform for all, and together we can ensure this happens.",

We will highlight the good practices on how to decouple modules, how to loosely connect modules together, which traps to avoid and common sources of module coupling with their solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will factor into our modularization strategy a “cost of module”, which is not neglectable and balance that against the benefits modules bring. We will look for good modules and bad modules to optimize and make sure that all modules bring positive value.\r\nThe talk will show how to measure and automatically identify problematic modules and its dependencies paths within our module graph to enable prioritizing whilst incrementally improving the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved impact on the metrics of build time, contributions across teams, cost of modules and more will be shown. Insights will be shared on how to convince the organization to invest engineering time into modularization and how to synchronize the effort across teams from different departments. Modularization is treated and prioritized as a business enabler rather than just engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modularization journeys keep showing that if we invest effort, the return of that investment can come back soon. Yet modularization also shows us that it is crucial to focus, explain and measure exactly why we modularize and point our efforts in the right direction to prevent getting more cost of modularization than benefits.\r\n",

We rely on the work of contributors, companies, and foundations which are dedicating their time and resources to the Open Source ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, building Open Source Software is not as easy as copy-n-pasting a folder on GitHub. Great Open Source Software needs dedicated resources, top-notch documentation, openness to the community, and a mindset to follow industry trends and directions.\r\nMoreover, releasing OSS as an individual and as a company has deep fundamental differences.\r\n\r\nInside the React Team, we strive to build first-class OSS frameworks, to empower developers across the globe to build elegant UI experiences across Mobile & Web.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll walk you through my experience building OSS Software, how you can get started, how to get your organization involved, and how to bring your project to success.",

Over the past two years we’ve been building and refining a framework to allow us to track and visualise the Availability and Performance of the features in our app in a clear and consistent way to ensure that we are delivering the best experience for our travellers.\r\n\r\nThis talk will go through our journey, covering areas including:\r\n- How to effectively define \"what\" you should be monitoring\r\n- How to write and provide client-side code that makes this easy for engineers\r\n- How to understand and transform this data into something clear and meaningful\r\n\r\nBy walking through the above, we will be looking at the Android code as well as touching on basic concepts around Data Pipelines and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). However no previous knowledge of these is required and hopefully this talk will be a good introduction! ",

After all, there’s a lot more to eliminating ANRs than just preventing the main thread from being blocked for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nGoogle Play Console stack traces frequently point to code that was not responsible, which leads to endless dead ends and frustration. In addition, the Android documentation does not spell out all the time thresholds that cause ANRs to be triggered at the OS level.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we’ll take a deep dive into how ANRs are monitored, processed, and triggered at the OS level, providing mobile engineers with a better understanding of how they can protect their apps from ANRs:\r\n\r\n- How the OS triggers ANRs in Activities, Services\r\n- BroadcastReceivers, and ContentProviders\r\n- What data is collected by the OS for each type of ANR\r\n- Why Firebase Crashlytics and Google Play Console display different ANR data\r\n- What are the different approaches to detecting ANRs in production\r\n",

No need to worry, though: if you find yourself needing more than what comes out of the box, Flow operators are much easier to write than you would expect.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, we’ll see how Flow operators are made, and how we can implement even the most complex behaviors with a handful of lines by leveraging the power of coroutines. :kotlin-intensifies:",

Have you ever shared a document but only gotten comments that seem to miss the point? Or have you reviewed a pull request where you don't understand what the author is trying to do, but the code looks good enough (after some nit-picky changes) that you \"LGTM\" and approve it?\r\n\r\nYou might think of feedback as either stressful, scary or tedious, but it's necessary for change and growth.

With Android 13, developers have backwards compatible tools to set application languages at runtime. In this talk, you'll learn how to leverage these to build for a global and multilingual audience.\r\n\r\nConsider this user journey to understand why this is important: You've moved to Germany from the Netherlands. You enjoy using entertainment, messaging, and news apps in your native language, Dutch. Some apps work better in German, like your local banking or language-learning app. You prefer to navigate through the rest of your phone in English as you’re used to the English digital terms.\r\n\r\nCome join us as we dive into this highly anticipated feature. And provide your multilingual end users the ability to fluently set your application’s language according to their preferences.",

In early 2021 the Client UI team at Twitter began the task of integrating Jetpack Compose into the Twitter for Android app, with the goal of allowing developers to efficiently write new UI features.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Chris & Nacho will outline the process which the team has undertaken to adopt Jetpack Compose sustainably. They will explore the static tooling which has been written to guide developers instantly, how our design system components have evolved in that time, the processes that have been established to support feature teams. We’ll also cover some of the mistakes that we’ve made along the way.",

But, what else can you find out and what can you do with it?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show how to use ADB as a window into the internal workings of the Android operating system. I will begin with system services, which are the core of Android, and show how to dump state, interact with them from the command line, and how to send binder messages. You can, for example, place a\r\nphone call from the command line\r\n\r\nAt an even lower level, we have native services. These are Unix daemons that are started during early boot. You can list them, start and stop them, and even restart the Android run-time\r\n\r\nNext, file permissions: what prevents an app or service from accessing a file? This is a story of Unix file permissions and SELinux policy. I will show how you can see the permissions and the policy, and change them - but only if you have root access\r\n\r\nFinally, I will look at system properties. These are global variables used throughout Android to tune the framework, to record status information and to act as signals when a property changes\r\n",

        "description": "Molecule is a library for turning Composables into Flows. But how does that happen? What are the advantages and disadvantages to building and running your own Compositions, and where to even start?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll cover the history of reactive design patterns with Kotlin, Coroutines, Compose, and how Molecule gives you the ability to compose your own business logic into functional units. How you might use this for unit testing, and how the role of architecture components fits into the equation.\r\n\r\nWe’ll show you why you might want to do such a thing, and where it might make sense not to. How Molecule works under the hood, and help you to understand where, when and how you should use it.",

While these methods provide a great way to catch regressions before they make it into production, determining what to test, how to create good tests to catch that “what”, and orchestrating tests at scale in CI introduces many new challenges to the mix.\r\n\r\nI plan to give an intermediate-level talk about how to solve those new challenges when performance testing in CI.\r\n\r\nI plan for audience members to leave my talk learning:\r\n\r\n- What mobile performance metrics are worthy of being tested on mobile in CI vs what’s best suited for using production data.\r\n- What makes for a truly useful performance test. (controllable, user-impacting, reproducible, i.e. doesn't deal with network/IO latency, focuses on rendering performance and on-device functionality)\r\n- How to build those truly useful tests to benchmark the mobile-specific metrics we determined we wanted to measure (leveraging Macrobenchmark/UiAutomator).\r\n- How to combine all the previous points to orchestrate consistent and accurate tests on both emulators and real, physical devices in CI.",

Those frames can be manipulated, modified, beautified in any manner before previewing or recording it. \r\nYou can even add your custom views like static images or even 3D face mask or any 3D object in the preview after detecting objects like the face in frames. This entire process is called rendering objects in camera preview frames.\r\n\r\nNot only rendering, but we can also apply various filters like Sepia, grayscale and many more before previewing each frame. \r\nThese all features can be utilized in any android app using OpenGL.\r\n\r\nhow a view or camera frame is drawn on the screen?\r\nWhat is OpenGL?\r\nhow OpenGL controls GPU rendering?\r\nWhat are vertex and fragment shaders?\r\nHow do they affect the camera frame and preview?\r\nHow can we modify the camera frames between camera APIs and previewing?\r\nWhat all can we do with that?\r\n\r\nWell, let's get all these questions answered in the talk along with our experiences and challenges we've faced.",

Usually, we do not want just to create an app - we want to build THE product. We want to create something that will be used by our users every day, something that will bring them joy and make their life easier. Thus, it's crucial to keep a finger on the pulse of the users' behaviour, understand their struggles and needs, and later make observation-based decisions to improve our products. In this talk, I will share some real-world tips and tricks used in developing THE products with Flutter.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers three main app observation strategies:\r\n1) App monitoring - logs, error & crash reports, performance metrics;\r\n2) Product metrics - app metrics and analytics;\r\n3) UX - internal and external user feedback.",

Let's take a deep dive into the cookbook of an attacker. What angles are malicious users of your app looking from? What did the actual exploited source code look like? What does a typical exploitation process look like?\r\n\r\nWe will also look at the different ways the mobile industry is trying to protect itself against these attacks. Acronyms like OWASP, MASVS, and MASA are nice, but do they really spoil the appetite of an attacker?\r\n\r\nWe'll explain what we at Guardsquare see as the next step in mobile application security, and how you can both contribute to this and benefit from it today.

But let’s challenge that assumption. Inside a team, it’s everyone’s responsibility to bring technical skills, but also to embrace different opinions, build trust, nurture curiosity, and learn from failures. Each individual has the power to influence a psychologically safe team culture. So, what do you bring to the table?\r\n\r\nAs Android developers we don’t just bring code to our teams. We should be bringing our whole authentic selves and contributing to a team culture where everyone feels safe to do so too.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, managers and team members will have the opportunity to reflect on who they are at work, how they contribute to the team beyond code, and take away practical ideas for how to create psychologically safe teams.",

        "description": "TDD can sound like the simple solution to all your problems, promising a comprehensive test suite and high-quality code that basically writes itself. But test-driving a complex app can be a daunting task in practice. At Moonpig we now use TDD every day, but it took time, effort and discipline to overcome the challenges that we faced along the way.\r\n\r\nAre you struggling with TDD? Have you tried it with simple algorithmic problems but can't figure out how to approach a complex app? Or perhaps you're keen to try it but you need to convince the rest of your team. Or you're just new to the whole idea and are trying to figure out where to start.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll start by covering the core concepts of TDD, how to get started, and look at a few common mistakes. We'll discuss different approaches to TDD and highlight Android-specific patterns that have worked well for us in practice. Finally, we'll look at how we purposefully designed our architecture to foster and maintain a culture of test-driven development from the core of our app - and how you can too.",

Is my project going to be publicly exposed and vulnerable?\r\nIn this talk, Rosário will be answering these questions and will provide a comprehensive security checklist for Android developers to make sure that their app is not unintentionally exposing their Firebase project.\r\nExpect to come out of the session with a better understanding of the importance of Firebase’s Security Rules, Firebase App Check and Firebase Auth.

        "description": "A cold-blooded war is raging on Android between “what users can do with their devices” and “how much their device lasts on one charge”. Each new Android OS version is less merciful to your background processes. Different OEMs kill your apps straight away without asking whether you do something useful for your users or not. New weapons of mass destruction are being invented year by year. Their names? Doze mode V1!, Doze mode V2!, Background restrictions!, Adaptive battery! and more are coming this year whose evil names are yet to be known. But we can already imagine their devastating powers.\r\n\r\nSome OEMs are more cruel than others. The darkest warlords of them all? Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and Xiaomi in that order. They employ elite trained assassins called app killers whose insidious ways are yet to be documented.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to survive, but there is hope. A small group of relentless developers (let’s call them the Resistance) gathered around a project called dontkillmyapp.com. They have risen up against the evil hordes of pkill -9. They have years of experience with long running processes and alarms on Android since the carefree times of Cupcake till the dawn of Tiramisu. And they are here to share tips and guides with users and developers on how to survive in these dark times.\r\n\r\nOn Stardate 2020.7 we released a benchmark app to measure the level of dark practices different OEM-overlords use directly on the affected phones. And no later than Stardate 2022.7 we passed the force field of \"Google review process\" only to merge it directly into Android's source code within the CTS module - known as Compatibility Test Suite (or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?).\r\n\r\nNow we (the developers from the Light side) can use this new Force to defend our apps. Every one of us can use the the Force of CTS-D (CTS-Defender Module) tests and even submit new tests and show the whole Galaxy who is killing apps and how!\r\n\r\nViva la Resistance!\r\nP.S. we also have cookies and a guitar song at the end!",

It doesn't scale, doesn't support dependencies and is not testable.\r\n\r\nDart to the rescue! Sidekick generates a Dart command-line application for you. You can use the built-in command\r\n\r\n- `deps` gets all dependencies for all packages\r\n- `gen` runs the build_runner, and formats the code afterwards\r\n- `format` runs dart format across the project, ignores generated files.\r\n\r\nor use the project a starting point for you own commands to be shared with your team. Need some ideas?:\r\n\r\n- Automatically bump your version number\r\n- Release your app to the Play Store / AWS / Firebase\r\n- Generate a changelog based on the merged PRs\r\n- Home-made build flavors: Switch between environments by editing and swapping of some files",

Luckily there are some tools provided to us to make our lives easier. Tools like Amplify DataStore provides a programming model for leveraging shared and distributed data without writing additional code for offline and online scenarios, which makes working with distributed, cross-user data just as simple as working with local-only data.\r\n\r\nWith this talk, I will share my experience with thinking \"offline\" first with the applications I worked on before. You will learn about, what Flutter offers for being \"offline\" first, how you can achieve a great experience for your users by architecting your app the correct way, and most importantly, you will learn what NOT to do. :) ",
