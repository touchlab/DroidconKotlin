        "description": "​​Koin is the Kotlin dependency injection framework well known for its ease of use and efficiency. It has been greatly appreciated by the Android community since 2017.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, a new major version of the framework is released: Koin 3.2. I invite you to discover all the new features and improvements. Let’s explore the great new DSL that still continues to simplify our writings, also the new module hierarchy organization capacity, and much more. \r\n\r\nThe Koin Annotations project is also getting to its first stable version: 1.0. It’s a great time to see all you can do with these annotations, powered by Google KSP under the hood. \r\n",

        "title": "5 Common Traps You Can Step Into When Using Coroutines",
        "description": "1. Talk description\r\nCoroutines are a brilliant way to apply async programming in Kotlin projects, since they help us to avoid callback hell. On the surface, they seem to be very easy to use, however there are many not so obvious traps, you can step into if you're new to them. This presentation will cover 5 of the most common and biggest mistakes you can make when using coroutines.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Key takeaways\r\n\r\n1. Using async to avoid executing suspending calls sequentially\r\n\r\n2. Coroutines aren't cancellable by default - you have to set them up for that\r\n\r\n3. Build your suspend functions around the concept of main-safety\r\n\r\n4. Catching general exceptions in coroutines can mess up that cancellation is properly propagated\r\n\r\n5. Exposing suspend functions in a ViewModel to the UI is not what you should do - the lifecycle will get in your way\r\n\r\n\r\n3. My experience level with this topic\r\nI've been using Kotlin for 3 years on a day-to-day basis. In that time, I've mostly used coroutines and Flows for async programming which helped me to understand the subject well, since I've had a lot of time to make mistakes and learn from them.\r\n\r\n4. Have I given this talk before?\r\nNot as a talk, but as a YouTube video which was extremely well received: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr5xLjPC4-0&ab_channel=PhilippLackner\r\n\r\nHaving made this video, I can also benefit a lot from the feedback I got there to make the talk even better.\r\n\r\n5. Some additional keywords\r\ncoroutines, async programming",

From just running a few unit tests to automatically promoting your application to beta and onwards to production on the Play Store, and everything in between. They do, however, have a few things in common, like helping us collaborate and ship better applications.\r\n\r\nIn this not-really-a-cooking-show we will take a series of steps on our journey to cooking up a complete, Michelin starred CI/CD pipeline for a native Android application - using the ingredients already in your cupboard, like Kotlin and your favourite Gradle plugins!\r\n\r\nSome of the things we will cover:\r\n\r\nVarious types of tests\r\nSecurity and static checks\r\nReleasing and promoting on Play Store\r\nProject management tooling integrations\r\nManual revisions\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd more!",

Apps face bottlenecks and performance issues as they grow, and often continuing good programming practices will not suffice to keep their behavior on track. Integration of third-party APIs, complex access to hardware or just pushing the limits of what Android offers can often lead to a slower and buggier app. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith a proper benchmark strategy, you will be able to identify and resolve issues on your app before they become too big. This talk showcases the newly released framework from Google, JankStats, and how to use it on a real-world app. We will compare it with other already existing Google solutions. As a bonus, we will cover strategies and scenarios where we can integrate our benchmark suits on a CI/CD platform and keep track of regressions and improvements on our app.",

        "description": "Sometimes you want to automate some boring tasks (for example, measuring the execution time of annotated methods or logging method calls with their arguments) or modify third-party dependencies in your own favor.\r\n\r\nThe Android Gradle plugin (AGP) has been providing Transform API for such cases, but it's proved to be inefficient and may be the cause of slow builds. The new API is much more efficient and easier to consume, so one can directly start modifying bytecode with almost zero-setup.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the new transform API, how it compares to the old one, touch a little bit on the JVM bytecode internals and show how this API can be useful for automating otherwise tedious or even impossible, from the source code perspective, tasks.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we'll try to turn all android Logcat logs into Timber logs (even the ones coming from third-party dependencies), to feed all log streams into a single source.",

        "description": "Solving performance problems at scale has always been tricky. There is a lot of confusion on how to address those problems in android. \r\nIn this talk, we will try to understand the nature of the performance problems, how to select tooling for these issues, and also try to make a generic approach that could apply to most of the problems.\r\n\r\n1. Performance problems that happen at scale like cold start, battery, crashes, ANR, etc.\r\n2. Common characteristics of these problems:\r\n- Indeterministic\r\n- We get to know about them when things go out of hand\r\n- Affects business timelines\r\n- They create a sense of urgency\r\n- Hard to create observability\r\n3. Anti methodologies: Explaining some of the common anti methodologies or pitfalls that developers fall into while solving these issues as also referenced by Brendan Gregg (Performance Engineer from Netflix) in his book.\r\n4. Describing a generic methodology and tools to solve performance issues methodically by taking cold start as a simple example:\r\n- Identify important metrics to chase for the issue, with a good signal to noise ratio\r\n- Stop bleeding by putting a quality gate on the baseline branch\r\n- Identify impacted sessions from production and get the telemetry data (traces, metrics, counters, etc.) selectively for impacted sessions\r\n- Identify problems in impacted reports to bring down the baseline\r\n5. Conclusion:\r\n- There is no best tool for solving performance issues\r\n- You have to find a set of tools that help to create the methodology for chasing those issues\r\n- Relying more on methodology rather than tool first\r\n",

Using sheep for everything, of course!\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you should have a better understanding of the basics behind Compose Animations and how you can use that knowledge to create more complex, interesting and charming animations.\r\n\r\nAnimations can seem daunting at first, but I promise you, they have never been easier.

Operating in 50+ countries and processing 10+ Millions of orders per day, we needed to take Crashlytics to the next-level.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we would like to share our experience on how we built our custom crash-reporting tooling that is built using powerful tools like Google BigQuery, and Google Data Studio. Using Google BigQuery also gave us the ability to transform and clean our raw data and join with Firebase Analytics datasets. At the end of our presentation, we would like to present a couple of real-life scenarios and show you how we used our custom dashboard to decrease our root cause finding time and saved our engineers time more than 40%.",

        "description": "Development, testing, and deployment aren't the only aspects of Mobile DevOps. Security must also be integrated into the entire lifecycle of mobile app releases in order to fully exploit the agility and responsiveness of the Mobile DevOps approach.\r\n\r\nAs a result of today's collaborative Mobile DevOps approach, security becomes a shared responsibility integrated from the start of the process. We call this principle \"DevSecOps\" to highlight that all DevOps initiatives must be founded on a solid security foundation.\r\n\r\nMobile DevOps integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire development lifecycle with DevSecOps culture, automation, and platform design.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that we do not have any security vulnerabilities before releasing mobile apps to our customers, I will be discussing Mobile DevOps in this presentation and how we can integrate the automated security checks for our mobile apps into the Android CI/CD pipelines.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will cover: \r\n- Shift-left testing in mobile apps.\r\n- DevOps VS. DevSecOps\r\n- Choose the suitable security testing methods\r\n- Mobile App Security Checklist\r\n- OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standards\r\n- Add Automated Security Tests to the pipeline\r\n\r\nI give this talk before with Android Worldwide \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEjdbcBW-TU\r\n\r\nBut in Droidcon I will add more demos using a different set of tools for static and dynamic security testing.

However, in the real world failures happen, and dealing with them is as important as the happy pah.\r\n\r\nKotlin and the standard library offer some approaches for dealing with errors like nullable types and sealed classes. But for many robust applications that might not be enough! I will present the tools and techniques offered by the Arrow library that builds on top and complements what Kotlin offers and helps you achieve composable error handling logic with a minimal amount of boilerplate code.\r\n\r\nAfter attending this talk, you will have yet another tool in your toolbelt that will help you build robust applications.\r\n",

In this session you will learn how to extend IntelliJ IDEs functionality at runtime using Kotlin and LivePlugin. In particular, you will learn API basics for plugin development, how to create actions to modify text/code, DSL for simple UI elements and language inspections/intentions.\r\n",

We will be using Jetpack WindowManager in Jetpack Compose and View-based apps. We will also tackle legacy apps, because existing apps should work great on foldables, too.\r\n\r\nWhat's covered?\r\n- What are foldable devices, what are their unique selling points?\r\n- What challenges do the have for devs?\r\n- Which APIs and libraries are relevant?\r\n- What is Jetpack WindowManager and how is it used in both Java and Kotlin?\r\n- How is the lib used in a Compose app, how in a View-Based app?\r\n- How do you make an existing app foldable-aware?",

        "description": "Gesture navigation is a core part of Android and plays a crucial role in how users interact with their phones every day. Providing a consistent and predictable interaction is critical for creating a high-quality user experience. Ensuring your app works with gesture navigation helps create a more harmonious UX that the platform aims to achieve in Android 13 and forward by supporting the ahead-of-time APIs and removing support for  KEYCODE_BACK and onBackPressed APIs. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll learn best practices for gesture navigation by transforming an app with a poor UX into one that users will love. These APIs handle common quality aspects such as: enabling predictive back gesture, managing visual overlaps to support edge-to-edge, handling gesture conflicts for visual components, leveraging immersive modes, and more.\r\n",

And with that, I have always tried different solutions to different community problems I have experienced them myself. And lots of them, FAILED 😞. But even though I experienced so many FAILURES I kept on dreaming and came across a problem in which I have been experiencing ever since I started university, where this forced me to relocate 1500km from my home town to another province. It was nightmare to go to and from the other province (by bus). And with that painful and expensive experience I had, decided to create an app that helps people in need of traveling all across Mozambique and South-Africa, book their bus tickets effortlessly.",

It was hard to maintain mainly because no-one in the team really knew how it worked and because of a lack of good documentation, so we ended up deciding to build a new and more reliable CI/CD.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I’ll share the story of how we migrated to GitHub \r\nActions. Outline challenges we faced and how we solved them. And finally show how we went even further, by improving on the previously existant CI in different ways, in terms of features, performance and even costs. \r\n\r\nI hope to show how easy it is to build a CI for an Android project without the need of maintaining complex Docker images nor any kind of infrastructure.",

As well as a chance to write more intuitive code, this also gave us an opportunity to build a library of reusable UI components, making it easier for our teams to build and deliver new features for our users, and allowing us to go beyond the limitations of Material Design. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will look at: how to go about implementing a design system and theming in Compose - either by extending Material or creating custom components; what changes you may need to consider around your existing architecture, navigation and testing when migrating to Compose; and how to communicate the changes between developers across different teams and to the business.\r\n",

        "description": "Kotlin Multiplatform is a modern, powerful tool for multiplatform development. The main idea of Kotlin Multiplatform, as well as other cross-platform SDKs, is to optimize development by writing code once and share it between different platforms. However, dealing with a common code base could have some nuances that should be figured out and solved according to the platform specifics. And implementation in a common base could be really tricky. One such moment is a providing common solution for multithreading and concurrency. Especially for iOS, because it doesn't support the same technologies as Android does. KMM SDK uses the specific for every native platform version of Kotlin: Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, or Kotlin/Native. Every version includes special Kotlin language extensions, tools, and libraries specified for a particular platform. The module created with Kotlin language will be compiled by JVM to bytecode for Android and by LLVM to bytecode for iOS. Kotlin Native is really different from Kotlin JVM because it depends on the specifics of the iOS platform. Most default solutions that work with JVM are not suitable for Kotlin Native at all. \r\nI would like to examine the specifics of both platforms, to show the difference between Kotlin Native and Kotline JVM, what problems could be faced in providing a common solution for both platforms, and the ways to provide a working solution. And how to work with new memory management model in 1.6.0 version of Kotlin/Native",

In this talk, we take a closer look at Lazy layouts in Compose and how this API enables adding content on demand. We will learn about Lazy composables - how and when to use them, how they are built and how they work under the hood, as well as how to change their default implementation to adjust them to your specific design needs. We will also talk about how to optimise for performance with faster scrolling, why you should always provide unique keys, as well as avoid 0-pixel sized items and nesting components scrollable in the same direction. Understanding the low level details of how Lazy works in Compose can set the path for implementing custom Lazy layouts for more complex requirements. We will also take a look at some exciting new features, such as Lazy grids and item animations.",

For example, not everyone has unlimited data in their mobile plans, or reliable connectivity. The reality is that Android apps must compete with one another for limited resources.\r\n\r\nFrom the newly published O'Reilly book \"Programming Android with Kotlin: Achieving Structured Concurrency with Coroutines\", this talk examines a range of memory leaks in concurrency clashing lifecycles, network data format, and more.\r\n\r\nPerformance considerations allow you to examine concerns that may impact your application’s ability to scale. If you can use any of these strategies as “low-hanging fruit” in your code base, it’s well worth going for the biggest win with the smallest amount of effort.",

Can it be so simple?\r\nIt can!\r\nIn this talk we will explore a super efficient and perfect way to navigate with Jetpack Compose by leveraging Voyager.\r\nWe will also compare the up and coming Voyager navigation library with Google's Jetpack Compose Navigation and explain why Jetbrains uses Voyager in their samples.\r\nYou will learn how to do super easy, typesafe Navigation with custom Transitions in less than 10 minutes of setup. \r\nAs a next step we will use Voyager for Tabs and Dialogs and even show you how to take your Navigation Multiplatform for KMM.\r\nLearn from our more-than-one-year in-production use of Jetpack Compose at IBM and get ready to ditch Fragments for good.\r\n",

In fact, we will share concrete tactics and solutions on how we have solved real world productivity problems at Freeletics. Amongst others: how do we deal efficiently with dependency injection, how we have reduced repetitive tasks and the need of writing boilerplate code, in app navigation in a highly modularized repository while keeping build times acceptable, how an architecture tailored for productivity can accelerate teams without sacrificing maintainability or readability, speeding up writing efficient tests.\r\n\r\nGain guidance and inspiration from this talk on how you can improve your and your Android colleagues productivity.",

However, as you progress beyond \"POC\" to integrating and shipping real production code, the design of the \"SDK surface\" becomes more complicated and nuanced (or, possibly, problematic).\r\n\r\nMany SDK design considerations are common, whether you have a Kotlin module in a single monorepo, are an internal team publishing SDK's for your org (a very common KMP use case), or a vendor publishing an SDK for public consumption.\r\n\r\nSome topics we'll cover:\r\n\r\nAn Android consumer can see all the richness of the Kotlin language, but the iOS side gets filtered through Objctive-C into Swift. Much can get lost along the way. You need to understand and plan for this.\r\n\r\nExposing too much to the iOS surface not only makes navigating documentation difficult but can have a significant binary size impact. We'll discuss what to look for and the techniques to use.\r\n\r\nPackaging and publishing of iOS artifacts have a number of things to consider, including format, package manager compatibility, location, etc.\r\n\r\nWe'll walk through these topics and more to share what we've learned over the last few years of KMP/KMM production development.",

        "description": "There are numerous ways of developing mobile apps today, but how do you ensure that your app is properly secured? What are the threats you should be concerned about and what can you do to avoid being an easy target? If you don't want to miss anything, leveraging a standard is essential. Google understands this very well and since April 2022 acknowledges developers who had their apps independently validated against the OWASP MASVS.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll introduce you to the OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard), which works together with the OWASP MSTG (Mobile Security Testing Guide) to help you understand the attack surface of mobile apps, how to exploit them and how to protect them. Both resources are crafted and are curated by a team of numerous experts and community contributors.",

Building android apps while keeping a security perspective in mind is important for our users. We will talk about different functionalities in our mobile apps which can use some security first perspective such as storing the data on the device based on the information the data contains. In fact storing the data is the most basic functionality we use in our mobile apps.

Along with its main app, Deezer has also released Deezer for Creators, Audiobooks by Deezer, Android-TV apps, and (soon) a public SDK. Many other businesses have expanded as well - you can think of Uber with Uber Eats or BlaBlaCar with BlaBlaCar Daily for instance.\r\n\r\nThese applications share a lot of common code, from authentication to playback engine, to Design System. Is there a way to factorise it?\r\n\r\nAt Deezer, we chose to publish our code in libraries, which led us to reflect on:\r\n- the content of these libraries,\r\n- the extraction of features and components into a library,\r\n- the organisation of the libraries (e.g. single or multiple libraries, library modules),\r\n- the versioning and the handling of repositories (monorepo vs multiple repos),\r\n- the release of libraries and their integration into projects.\r\n\r\nOur return on experience will help you discover possible solutions, better understand the pitfalls to avoid (as we fell into some of them), and see how private libraries could benefit your own organisation.\r\n",

There's also compatibility gotchas because of the lack of metadata.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with a mention of the different problems that come with dependency management in real-world projects. Then, we will see what Gradle's new \"Version catalogs\" can do for us. Then it'll show how the developer tool [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions) (MIT licensed) tackles some of these issues in Gradle projects, saving a lot of time when upgrading dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll talk about what the future can be for dependency management, be it from new features in future Gradle versions, or tools or conventions that the community can create to improve the status quo.",

This talk will show how our server-side UI approach works, and some of the reasons that made us adapt this. Additionally, the talk covers the tools we use to make this possible: an internal tool called  \"Choice Expressions\" and an implementation of JsonSchema, both used to build UIs from a set of conditions.\r\n\r\nLastly, we'll talk about some of our future plans, including but not limited to adopting Jetpack Compose in the apps.",

Testing them requires some extra work and a solid understanding of coroutine concepts like scopes and dispatchers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the new guidance we've released for testing coroutines on Android, using the latest available testing APIs introduced in kotlinx.coroutines 1.6. We'll go from the simplest cases all the way to Flows, look at Android-specific problems you might face, and learn best practices and patterns you can use in your tests.",

        "description": "In a world where mobile users are bombarded with notifications at every moment of the day simply sending notifications has become a terrible user experience. Often notifications are completely ignored by the user and swiped away before they are read. So how can we ensure that users are notified about important events and still make sure they have a personal and enjoyable experience?\r\n\r\nWe will take a brief look at the history of notifications within Android, how they are presented to users, and try to understand why users are less interested in notifications now more than ever. Knowing this how can we more effectively communicate with our users? \r\nTaking what we have learned we can look towards new options like communication APIs and explore several scenarios that show how these APIs can build truly useful interactions with users. \r\n\r\nFrom this talk, you will come away with a better understanding of how communication APIs work, and how they can be used to create interesting and new user experiences. How you might go about creating an interactive automated conversation which could easily be integrated into your application or carried out externally via SMS, WhatsApp or Facebook Messanger. \r\n",

The answer is Compose Runtime. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will see how we can use Compose Runtime to create client libraries. Firstly, we will talk about Compose nodes, Composition, Recomposer, and how they are orchestrated to create a slot table. Then, we will see how the changes in the slot table are applied with an Applier. Moreover, we will touch upon the Snapshot system and how the changes in the state objects trigger a recomposition.

How about you would be able to actually see the discrepancy between the result and the expectation, without needing to decipher cryptic exceptions. Luckily this is easy for simple data types, but how about dealing with huge custom types? Is there a way of visualizing those differences?\r\n\r\nThe answer will be presented in this talk: The idea is to leverage the power of utf-8 and transforming the complex datasets into human readable or even visually pleasing data sets, so you can immediately see, where the error is.\r\n\r\nBy the example of a simple chess app, I will visualize some tests looking like this\r\n\r\n\"█░█░█░█░\\n\" +\r\n\"░█░█░█░█\\n\" +\r\n\"█░█░█░█░\\n\" +\r\n\"░█░█░█░█\\n\" +\r\n\"█░█░♟░█░\\n\" +\r\n\"░█░█*█░█\\n\" +\r\n\"█░█░█░█░\\n\" +\r\n\"░█░█░█░█\\n\",\r\n\r\nmaking the failure way more easier to spot and then also to correct.\r\n\r\nJoin for learning more about unit tests easing, utf-8 characters, and how to leverage those learnings for your use cases.",

        "description": "Technology is being used in many ways to help drive aid into Ukraine, to help fight Russian aggression and support refugees who need housing, medical help, employment and more. This panel will look at some of the current solutions and look at where we as a community can fill the gaps.\r\nWhat are the most urgent needs and what can we do to help?\r\nWhat apps would be useful to develop?\r\nHow can we support Ukrainian devs who have lost jobs and homes?\r\nHow can we drive fundraising and support for Ukraine within the apps that we are already developing?\r\nWould welcome your feedback and help in finding some good panelists to join. I think we need some native Ukrainians on this for sure. Might even be good to get some perspectives from good NGOs or other organizations working with refugees who know what the situation is like on the ground. Need a good moderator and some great panelists for this. Any help is much appreciated.",

Any Android developer who has used Kotlin, Dagger and Room Persistence will be able to develop APIs.\r\n2. The session will focus on explaining our journey about indentifying similarities of Android and Backend Development (Ex: The Android App and Microservices both have application classes and are meant for the same purpose, the usecases/repositories we used in the MVVM architecture are exactly the same ones I used in my MicroService, etc.), and for static code analysis I even used the same library (KTLint).",

In the Android world, most Gradle plugins will have to interact with the Android Gradle plugin (AGP) in some way or another. It can be very easy to couple the code of your plugin to a specific version of AGP, leading to failures if people upgrade or use older versions. This is especially problematic if you want to offer your plugin to a broader audience.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we're going to showcase different techniques we can use to to write Gradle plugins that are compatible with multiple versions of the Android Gradle plugin. We're going to explore the  trade-offs that come with different approaches. We're also going highlight how we can test our plugins against multiple AGP versions and we're going to discuss when we should drop compatibility with old versions.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you're going to know several ways of writing backwards-compatible Gradle plugins that you can apply to your projects, whether you're working on commercial, open-source or internal Gradle plugins.",

        "description": "Unit tests are an important part of the development process. Among other things, they help us verify the correctness of our code.\r\n\r\nThus, when writing tests, we usually pick one or two relevant examples, let the tests run green and call it a day. This is called example-based testing.\r\n\r\nBut, is that enough? Have you missed any significant case? Have you considered all edge-cases? What if any of those non-tested examples would make the app crash?\r\n\r\nFear not, we can fill that gap with property-based tests. Let me show to you how, step by step.\r\n\r\nIn this tech-talk you will learn:\r\n- some easy tips to improve your unit tests\r\n- why example-based unit tests are not always enough\r\n- how property-based testing can make your tests more robust\r\n- property-based testing in very detail:\r\n    * what it is\r\n    * its pros and cons\r\n    * which tools/frameworks are available for implementing them\r\n    * how to make the most out of them\r\n\r\nAnd all that by using as examples some features you would find in most Android apps, like \"create account\" or \"text editing.",
