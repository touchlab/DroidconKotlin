        "description": "While Kotlin started on the JVM, and subsequently gained adoption in the Android community, it has evolved into a language that supports many platforms. Kotlin Multiplatform has emerged as a technology that allows us to create applications where code can be shared, and allowing developers to use as much as they want, when they want. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll take a look at how we got here, the mistakes we made along the way, and where we're heading. We'll share some of the plans and things we're working on, as well as the adoption of Compose for iOS after our recent announcement at KotlinConf!",

In this talk we’ll cover all these levels, discussing composable parameters, modifiers like clickable, tap gestures, the lower-level pointerInput modifier, and learn about tunneling and bubbling of events. We will also walk through some common but non-trivial examples.",

        "description": "At Scout24 we had the challenge of gracefully migrating millions of users to a new authentication system. Auth tokens between the two systems were incompatible and the consequences of mistakes during the migration would mean logging out huge swaths of users abrubtly, resulting in a \"disaster scenario\". \r\n\r\nAt Payback we needed to rewrite the app initialisers. In case the rewritten ones would not run in the same order as the old ones or some of them would not run at all, there would be a possibility of corrupted data or crashes at app startup resulting in a broken app for millions of users. \r\n\r\nDuring these two projects there were common practices, gotchas, and certain techniques that emerged from the whole experience. I have formalized these into an engineering process that I call \"Redundancy Driven Development\". \r\n\r\nThe talk will give examples of how to leverage state machines, legacy code running simultaneously with new code, feature toggles, staged rollouts and all the other tools which are available in the redundancy toolbox. \r\n\r\nDevelopers will learn how to leverage redundancy in confidently navigating through changes that have the potential to disrupt the whole codebase.

In the post-pandemic world remote job offers are much more desired by engineers - double the number of applicants for remote positions vs on-site ones. But what is crucial for an effective collaboration in distributed teams? How to create a bonded team out of a group of individuals with different cultural backgrounds? An analysis of an on-site setup that failed, and a remote one that succeeded. We will explore how different leadership styles can affect team cohesion - examples from autopsy and 10 years career as a software developer.\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will be equipped with practical strategies for managing a multicultural team. They will leave with a better understanding of what makes a successful remote team and easy to apply techniques for bonding its members.",

In fact, in the tech sector, it's difficult to miss discussion about how the jobs of today will inevitably be impacted by GPT-3.5 and, recently, GPT-4. With the arrival of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the massive amount of GitHub data Microsoft has used to train it, it's evident that OpenAI's large language models will also transform the software development process. In this discussion, Sofy CEO and founder Syed Hamid will share a variety of use cases that provide insight into how this technology is changing today's software testing landscape. Syed will also discuss how Sofy has harnessed the power of GPTs to further amplify Sofy's revolutionary no-code mobile app testing approach.",

We all know the horror stories, but few app developers can explain what parts of their app are actually at risk.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we want to turn these horror stories into learning opportunities. Let's take a deep dive into the cookbook of an attacker. What angles are malicious users of your app looking from? What did the actual exploited source code look like? What does a typical exploitation process look like?\r\n\r\nWe will also look at the different ways the mobile industry is trying to protect itself against these attacks. Acronyms like OWASP, MASVS, and MASA are nice, but do they really spoil the appetite of an attacker?\r\n\r\nWe'll explain what we at Guardsquare see as the next step in mobile application security, and how you can both contribute to this and benefit from it today.

We'll also highlight the challenges we ran in while upgrading the RevenueCat library to support these changes, many of which are incredibly relevant if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Android apps that still need to migrate away from PBL4 or even 3.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave the talk with a better understanding of real-world implementations of Billing Library 5, its benefits and its challenges, setting you up for a more successful migration down the road.\r\n\r\nDepending on this year's I/O, we'll update this talk with examples and insights pulled from PBL6 as they become available\r\n",

In Kotlin Coroutines, we maintain a dozen non-trivial concurrent data structures, such as queues, semaphores, and channels. We need to test them properly. Straightforward stress tests likely do not catch all bugs and flack. Such testing quality is below the bar. We need a way to write concurrent tests in a handy, declarative way, keeping in mind \"what to test,\" not \"how.\"\r\n\r\nAt JetBrains, we've developed Lincheck, a unique framework that makes writing concurrent tests a piece of cake. Users just need to list all the data structure operations, and Lincheck verifies whether these operations are thread-safe or not. In this talk, I will share how we use Linchek in Kotlin Coroutines, how to apply it to your setting, and briefly cover the framework internals.",

Being because there is a long gap between OEMs announcements and cars actually hitting the roads, because the number of potential users is incomparably smaller than for mobile devices, or simply due to a lack of knowledge of what is needed to build an app for AAOS.\r\n\r\nOn this session, we will present a step-by-step approach to bring apps live to Android Automotive, sharing the experience from TIDAL building an AAOS media app.\r\nAt the end of the session the participants should be able to know:\r\n- What is Android Automotive and how is it different from Android Auto\r\n- What is the difference between systems using Google Automotive Services (GAS) and non-GAS systems\r\n- What are “templated” apps\r\n- What is Car UI library and how OEMs are customizing it\r\n- How to make sure your app follows the driver distraction guidelines\r\n- How to build media apps for AAOS\r\n- What tools are available to develop and test your AAOS apps\r\n- How to deploy and publish your apps to the cars\r\nThe talk will be jointly presented by Nuno Palma and Ziad Al Halabi, bringing two different perspectives to the spotlight:\r\n- the one of an app developer that is building and publishing an app\r\n- the one of an app store and tools developer, that is building the tools to bring other apps into the cars.\r\n\r\nTAGS: Android Automotive, AAOS",

        "description": "In software development, mocking is a popular technique used to simulate dependencies and test behaviour without relying on external systems. However, as with any technique, there are pros and cons to using mocks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss why using mocks may not be the best approach and why we should instead use fakes or in-memory implementations of well-defined interfaces. We will explore the drawbacks of mocks, including how they can lead to brittle tests, slow down development, and make it difficult to refactor code.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, we will see how using fakes or in-memory implementations can provide faster feedback, increase confidence in the code, and make it easier to maintain tests as the codebase evolves. We will look at some examples of how to implement these alternatives, and how to make them useful in different testing scenarios.",

        "title": "Composing ViewModels: Breaking ViewModels into smaller self-contained UI models",
        "description": "In early times of Android development we used to have big activities. All view and business logic were being written in activities. Then fragments were introduced so that activities started to become leaner. Then several architectural patterns have started to appear in the Android scene: MVP, MVVM, MVI, etc. While all these were happening, ViewModel like classes started to get bigger and bigger. They have become the new big activities. However, we haven't often considered splitting view models into manageable self-contained granular ones.\r\n\r\nViews are composable and they can be composed to build bigger views. What about introducing smaller ViewModels, namely UI models, and using them to build composable UI models/View Models?  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce the micro-feature architecture that leverages granular UI models. We'll demonstrate how this approach enables us to create leaner UI hosts by breaking down view models into smaller, self-contained logical UI models. Moreover, we'll explore the distinctions between a UI model and a Jetpack ViewModel. \r\n\r\nWe'll delve into the advantages offered by micro-feature architecture, particularly in terms of single responsibility, composability, reusability, and testability. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how adopting this architecture can significantly enhance your development process and empower you to build high-quality, scalable applications which has highly dynamic contextual screens. \r\n\r\nMicro-feature architecture is used in several screens of 2 big apps in production which are now being used by 10M+ users. We will be also sharing our learnings about using this approach in these apps. ",

        "description": "In today's fast-paced development environment, implementing design systems is crucial for achieving consistency and efficiency in Android app development. However, designing and implementing a comprehensive design system can be a daunting task, especially without the proper automation tools.\r\n\r\nAt Trade Republic, our Design Systems team has been working on an automation tool that streamlines the design system implementation process for our Android development workflow. In this session, we will share our experience and insights on how automation tools can help developers translate designs into code and enforce design system rules automatically, reducing human errors and saving valuable development time.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will showcase our journey and highlight the importance of automation tools in accelerating the design system implementation process. We will focus on the following key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Exporting resources from Figma: Discover how we have leveraged automation tools to seamlessly export design assets, such as colours, typography, icons, and more, from Figma into the Android development environment.\r\n2. Snapshot testing Design System components: Learn how we have integrated snapshot testing techniques into our automation tools to ensure the visual consistency and integrity of Design System components across different Android devices and screen sizes.\r\n3. Localisation of resources: Explore our approach to automating the localisation of design resources, mostly strings resources for users across different languages.\r\n4. Annotation-based Design System gallery: Dive into the power of annotation-based automation tools that automatically generate a comprehensive gallery of Design System components, making it easy for developers to prototype and designers to QA components.",

        "description": "Common understanding that testing is part of Quality Assurance? What if I tell you that is not where Quality starts or ends. Where Quality Assurance comes up with the ideas there is Software Engineering to implement them. Those two should not be treated like separate islands, but can perfectly go as one. Combining these will give us the Quality Engineer.\r\n\r\nI will take you through the evolution of Quality Engineering and will show you how your team can benefit from it.\r\n\r\nI think it's safe to say that we are all on the same page when talking about how we can get a high quality product at the end through a process that fits the whole team and where every aspect of development is as important.\r\nWhere Quality Assurance in many companies has the knowledge to make sure all quality gates (manual and automated checks) are being achieved by testing until the release - Quality Engineers additionally to that, also has the knowledge about how those quality gates can be implemented, maintained, and improved.\r\nThis additional knowledge can make a huge difference in the way the quality of a product is being handled, because now we can extend quality to a much deeper level and offer support in a much broader way.\r\n\r\nQuality Engineering is about implementing the use of the right automated testing tools to provide a safety net for engineers and the rest of the team. The implementation of these testing tools is different for every company, because you need to figure out how these should relate to each other to benefit from them. But once they are implemented and used in a way that fits your team, you will notice how valuable they are.\r\n\r\nI can only speak from my experience and that is why I want to guide you through the process of how these were successfully implemented and handled within Just Eat Takeaway. Hopefully, this will give you some great insights on how to start this journey within your own team.\r\n\r\nThe talk will not contain all the testing tools that are available but will show you a combination of tools that worked for me and that I’m still working on with great passion, like:\r\n\r\n- Manual and Automation testing and how to achieve efficiency\r\n- Screenshot testing\r\n- Code-style analysis by using Sonarqube: A tool to secure code quality and code security\r\n- Quality Gates to secure performance, security, usability, functionality and reliability\r\n- How you can use scripts to optimize flows in your team.\r\n- CI/CD: A software development approach that emphasizes the continuous and automated integration, testing and delivery of code changes to ensure that software can be released reliably and quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer looks at the architecture they want to build the product - the Quality Engineer is looking for the architecture of the quality tools and checks which should be in place.\r\nThe presentation will be about the idea of how many different tools can be smartly built in a software development life cycle and how Quality Engineering is helping there.

What screen layout is best? This talk walks you through Jetpack WindowManager, a Jetpack library that provides all information your app needs to make the best of all screen sizes. And we'll look at Material Design Canonical Layouts, ready-to-use compositions that help layouts adapt for common use cases and screen sizes. On top of that, you'll learn about compose_adaptive_scaffold, a small open source library that minimizes your efforts for making your Compose apps become a first class citican on large screens",

In most cases you won't experience any negative consequences but sometimes you will see some performance issues, especially when scrolling through a list or animating elements.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will have a look on the topic of unnecessary recompositions by using 3.5 example situations and see, how we can detect the recompositions, how we can better understand what's actually going on and of course how to fix the shown issues.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk you will be able to check your app for recomposition issues, fix related findings in your own code base and know which patterns you might want to avoid while writing Composable functions in the future.\r\n",

Navigation became complex and difficult to manage due to multiple Android components like Activities, Fragments, and Composables. To address this issue, our team created a Navigator to act as a centralized place to manage navigation events. However, we realized that a better solution to ensure type-safety and simplify navigation code maintenance is required. This talk will present our team's experience with integrating Jetpack Compose and our journey toward implementing type-safe navigation using KSP and KotlinPoet. The speakers will discuss how these tools simplified navigation management, making it easier to understand and maintain, while also avoiding runtime errors.",

We will then outline the common issues that developers encounter when using Gradle build cache. These issues include incorrect build cache settings, conflicts with the build cache, and incorrect configurations.\r\n\r\nNext, we will provide solutions to these issues. We will discuss how to configure the build cache settings correctly to ensure optimal performance. We will also explain how to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers work on the same project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will discuss how to optimize the Gradle build cache for large-scale Android projects. We will provide tips on how to manage the cache for multi-module projects and how to set up a distributed cache for teams working on a shared project.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this presentation provides a summary to common Gradle build cache issues in Android development. By understanding the issues and implementing the solutions presented in this talk, developers can optimize their build process and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow",

The proliferation of cloud-based identity providers has helped, with many offering convenient client-side SDKs that help you build faster. Amazon Cognito and AWS Amplify can do the heavy lifting of securely authenticating and authorizing your users, but you still need to implement UI flows for signing users up, resetting passwords, collecting confirmation codes, and verifying account recovery mechanisms - that’s a lot of work! That’s why we’ve built Authenticator, a drop-in solution in Jetpack Compose that, together with AWS Amplify, can get you from zero to done in minutes.\r\nIn this talk we will explore using AWS Amplify’s Authenticator component to add a complete authentication flow to your Jetpack Compose application in just minutes, with zero manual configuration. We’ll start with using the Amplify CLI to provision your backend, add Authenticator and AWS Amplify libraries, demonstrate the working example, and touch on some of the configuration and customization options available.",

        "description": "During many many years we always thought of becoming an expert at a particular technology. First learning the technology and lately mastering that subject.\r\nIn our careers, from a junior to a seasoned engineer perspective, we learned many lessons, mainly from our mistakes of course.\r\nWhen we trained for interviews, read books about software engineering or soft skills or even training for sports competitions. Under those circumstances we built courage, we became proud of what we made. Or at least we should be.\r\n\r\nIn this panel, we’ll share what we wish we knew when we started working as an amateur engineer. What would help us progress in our career in more ways than just management. What parallelisms between training for a sports competition could be applied to a developer’s preparation towards higher levels in a career ladder. The positive and negative signs that might indicate which path we might prefer to follow. Not all finish as a manager position if you like the engineering side of things. So why not follow your instincts?",

However, many codebases and applications still rely on RecyclerView, and some are still weighing the pros and cons of switching to lazy lists of Compose.\r\n\r\nRecently, I have been exploring the pros and cons of migrating from RecyclerView to Compose’s lazy lists. As we heavily use MVI at my company, it was essential to ensure proper diffing in the UI. Although we knew that Compose works well with MVI by recomposing only the desired portion of the view, the diffing mechanism of lists is slightly different which was still unexplored and thus led to this talk.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will understand how diffing is done in the context of RecyclerView. We will then explore how the good old DiffUtil's `areItemsTheSame` and `areContentsTheSame` translate into the world of Compose. In the process, we will also delve deeper into LazyList internals, including the lazy list's policy for reusing items using keys and content types.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, my goal is to provide guidance to those\r\n1. Still using RecyclerView to follow best practices\r\n2. Looking for answers before migrating to Compose’s LazyList\r\n3. Already using LazyLists to improve their performance\r\n\r\nAdditional tag: General Android",

Refactoring the entire codebase whenever a new technology becomes available is not always feasible or efficient. However, letting the codebase stagnate can result in a bloated, hard-to-maintain app.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will share our experience and best practices for keeping your Android app in a maintainable state for an extended period. We will cover two sides of maintenance: technology and social; Covering topics such as tooling, CI/CD, testing and refactoring strategies, as well as strategies to convince the management, establishing a culture and app vision.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to help you adopt a mindset prioritising maintainability and sustainability, so you can move towards a more modern and efficient codebase that can accommodate future libraries and technologies.",

        "description": "When developing an app you are faced with a difficult choice: which framework will you use to develop it? You can find evaluations of these frameworks containing their various pros and cons online. In this talk we want to dive a bit deeper into this topic by taking a reverse engineer's perspective: inspect and analyze the actual bundled application when using different frameworks.\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, we will ask ourselves several questions related to the framework choice. What impact does the shared framework code have, does it meaningfully impact the overall app size or performance? If the framework allows you to write code in non-JVM based code, where does that end up and how is this code executed in the app? Are there any obvious differences in security caused by a choice of framework?\r\n\r\nDuring this talk you will:\r\n- Learn the basics of some common Android reverse engineering tools\r\n- See the usage of such tools on several different framework applications\r\n- Learn about the difference in several Android frameworks (Flutter, React, ..) from this reverse engineering perspective\r\n- Learn what conclusions can be made on typical metrics these frameworks are compared by from this perspective",

We will discuss how to implement Protobuf in Android applications, including a basic implementation example. Additionally, we will review some benchmarks that demonstrate the efficiency of Protobuf usage and how it can improve mobile application performance. Finally, we will also discuss some common pain points and personal learnings when implementing Protobuf in a production project. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of Protobuf and how to leverage it to optimize their Android applications.",

        "description": "The official KMM sample generates a monorepo, which combines all the platforms (iOS & Android) and shared code into a single repository. However, in the real world or when integrating KMM into existing apps, they are often located in separate private repositories, each with their own dedicated tooling and CI/CD pipeline.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of a production app with multiple repositories, our team faced numerous challenges when attempting to automate KMM artifact generation and publication with separate repositories. In this presentation, we will discuss the changes required to support KMM in a multi-repository environment, including the use of Maven and GitHub release.\r\n\r\nWe will also address the specific challenges encountered during the iOS process and share our opinionated best practices for mitigating these constraints. This will include generating a podspec, downloading private artifacts, and linking to iOS.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this presentation, you will have a better understanding of how to generate and distribute KMM artifacts across multiple repositories, as well as how to integrate them seamlessly into your apps.",
