After playing around in many smaller projects like a \"4 Pictures 1 Word\" clone for film titles, I jumped into professional Android development and was part of the Android team at DB Navigator, the #1 public transport information app in Germany. Several years later I moved on to the next big project where I'm currently at: Chefkoch - Europe's largest online food platform. Luckily, being a good cook wasn't a requirement for joining them and so together with my colleagues I am constantly improving our Android app to help people finding delicious recipes and being a better cook than me (which is actually not hard at all).",
