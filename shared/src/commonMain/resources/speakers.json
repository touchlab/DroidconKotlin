After graduation, he spent nine years at Intel working on a vectorizing compiler for Haskell and an early predecessor of Verse.  In 2014, he joined Google to work on the Dart programming language and has been causing trouble there ever since.  In his spare time he enjoys cooking, playing squash, and bashing his way up and down some of the taller and more remote parts of Washington state.",
