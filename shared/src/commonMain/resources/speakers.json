    "bio": "It all started when Philipp was 13 and his mom gave him a book about C++. He immediately fell in love with coding. Over the years he got to try many awesome fields like Desktop development, game dev and backend development. \r\nHowever, he found what he really enjoyed when he started with native Android development in 2019. The fact that you could build something out of nothing you always have in your pocket just felt amazing for him. \r\nTo also help others on his journey, Philipp started to share Android content on Instagram. That content was well received and his page started gaining momentum. More and more people wanted him to start a YouTube channel as well, which he also did 2 months after starting posting on Instagram. \r\nToday, with roughly 6,000,000 views on YouTube (https://youtube.com/c/PhilippLackner), Philipp is one of the biggest active native Android YouTubers and is helping the Android community with regular easy-to-understand videos. On his Instagram pages @pl.coding (https://www.instagram.com/pl.coding) and @_philipplackner_ (https://www.instagram.com/_philipplackner_,) he built a combined following of around 100,000 mobile developers from around the globe.",
